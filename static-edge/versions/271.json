Instead of flat 1/20 chance of breaking after each pumping, we have four use states per pump, with a 1/10 chance of transitioning between use states after each pumping.  This gives us an estimated 40 pumpings before exhaustion, which much lower variance.  This is accomplished by installing a tank in the pump before pumping, which fills up with either 4 or 6 buckets worth of water, and is removed in one go (so the use counter of the pump can track its age and not how many buckets are left after a pumping).  In general, this means these pumps last 2x as long, and are much more reliable.","date":"2019-10-12T03:48:18.000Z","addedObjectIDs":["3164","3165","3167","3168"],"removedObjectIDs":["3035"],"addedTransitions":[{"targetID":"3044","newTargetID":"2345","decay":"1s"},{"targetID":"2234","newActorID":"3168","newTargetID":"2220","hand":true},{"targetID":"2234","targetUses":"last","newActorID":"3168","newTargetID":"3032","hand":true},{"targetID":"2352","newTargetUses":"-1","newTargetWeight":0.1,"newActorID":"3167","newTargetID":"2345","hand":true},{"targetID":"2352","targetUses":"last","newActorID":"3167","newTargetID":"3033","hand":true},{"actorID":"2302","targetID":"2222","newTargetID":"3164","hand":true},{"actorID":"2302","targetID":"2350","newTargetID":"3165","hand":true},{"actorID":"248","targetID":"3164","newActorID":"248","newTargetID":"2224","hand":true,"tool":true},{"actorID":"248","targetID":"3165","newActorID":"248","newTargetID":"2344","hand":true,"tool":true},{"actorID":"3167","actorUses":"last","newActorID":"2302","hand":true},{"actorID":"3168","actorUses":"last","targetID":"672","newTargetUses":"+1","newActorID":"2302","newTargetID":"672","targetRemains":true,"hand":true},{"actorID":"3169","newActorUses":"-1","targetID":"659","newActorID":"3169","newTargetID":"660","hand":true,"tool":true},{"actorID":"3169","actorUses":"last","targetID":"659","newActorID":"2302","newTargetID":"660","hand":true}],"removedTransitions":[{"actorID":"248","targetID":"2222","newActorID":"248","newTargetID":"2224","hand":true,"tool":true},{"actorID":"248","targetID":"2350","newTargetUses":"-1","newTargetWeight":0.1,"newActorID":"248","newTargetID":"2344","hand":true,"tool":true},{"actorID":"659","targetID":"2234","newTargetUses":"-1","newActorID":"660","newTargetID":"2234","targetRemains":true,"hand":true},{"actorID":"659","targetID":"2234","targetUses":"last","newActorID":"660","newTargetID":"3034","hand":true},{"actorID":"659","targetID":"2352","newTargetUses":"-1","newTargetWeight":0.1,"newActorID":"660","newTargetID":"2352","targetRemains":true,"hand":true},{"actorID":"659","targetID":"2352","targetUses":"last","newActorID":"660","newTargetID":"3035","hand":true},{"actorID":"659","targetID":"3044","newTargetUses":"-1","newTargetWeight":0.1,"newActorID":"660","newTargetID":"3044","targetRemains":true,"hand":true},{"actorID":"659","targetID":"3044","targetUses":"last","newActorID":"660","newTargetID":"3035","hand":true}],"objectChanges":[{"id":"2302","attributes":{"name":{"from":"Empty Fuel Tank","to":"Empty Tank"}}},{"id":"3044","attributes":{"name":{"from":"Wet Kerosene Newcomen Pump -  burner added","to":"Dry Kerosene Newcomen Pump -  burner added"}}}],"legacyObjects":[{"id":"2344","name":"Firing Kerosene Newcomen Pump","category":false},{"id":"2345","name":"Dry Kerosene Newcomen Pump","category":false},{"id":"2349","name":"Kerosene Newcomen Pump with Full Boiler","category":false},{"id":"2350","name":"Newcomen Pump with Kerosene","category":false},{"id":"2352","name":"Wet Kerosene Newcomen Pump","category":false},{"id":"3033","name":"Exhausted Kerosene Newcomen Pump","category":false},{"id":"3034","name":"Perhaps an Exhausted Pump","category":true},{"id":"3035","name":"Perhaps an Exhausted Kerosene Pump","category":false},{"id":"3044","name":"Dry Kerosene Newcomen Pump -  burner added","category":false},{"id":"3164","name":"Newcomen Pump with Tank","category":false},{"id":"3165","name":"Kerosene Newcomen Pump with Tank","category":false},{"id":"3167","name":"Tank of Water","category":false},{"id":"3168","name":"Tank of Water -  less full","category":false},{"id":"3169","name":"@ Any Water Tank","category":true}]},{"sha":"0ba4132dfe40f3941d3d891235c205dffa07749c","message":"Can shear skeep skin to make fleece.","date":"2019-10-12T00:54:39.000Z","addedTransitions":[{"actorID":"568","newActorUses":"-1","newActorWeight":0.04,"targetID":"593","newActorID":"568","newTargetID":"578","hand":true,"tool":true}]},{"sha":"327de90e4b1b70891fb8938d3613b8c32eb58a33","message":"Mouflon hide decays after 10 hours.","date":"2019-10-12T00:53:13.000Z","addedTransitions":[{"targetID":"564","decay":"10h"}]},{"sha":"5842e19addb2f6c5816d29b31e7dec54cfa54234","message":"Tarry spot now has 5 random placements on map, only in snowy biome.","date":"2019-10-12T00:49:46.000Z","objectChanges":[{"id":"2285","attributes":{"name":{"from":"Tarry Spot","to":"Tarry Spot -  randPlacement5"},"biomes":{"from":[4,5],"to":[4]}}}]},{"sha":"ec1e0b138e466ce882f9a935fb35f0731a517e17","message":"Added juniper and maple tree to end of tutorial.
