Thus, as soon as one part is rickety, you can walk around and renew the whole thing.  Before you felt psychological pressure to constantly check the fence, because various pieces would become rickety at different times, and you couldn't repair each one until then.  The renewed state is visually distinct and lasts 3 minutes.  Also fixed the naming of one of the fence configurations, and fixed some duplicate sprites.","date":"2019-07-22T19:48:41.000Z","addedObjectIDs":["3093","3095","3096"],"addedTransitions":[{"targetID":"3093","newTargetID":"2959","decay":"3m"},{"targetID":"3095","newTargetID":"2960","decay":"3m"},{"targetID":"3096","newTargetID":"2961","decay":"3m"},{"actorID":"33","targetID":"2959","newActorID":"33","newTargetID":"3093","hand":true,"tool":true},{"actorID":"33","targetID":"2960","newActorID":"33","newTargetID":"3095","hand":true,"tool":true},{"actorID":"33","targetID":"2961","newActorID":"33","newTargetID":"3096","hand":true,"tool":true},{"actorID":"33","targetID":"2976","newActorID":"33","newTargetID":"3093","hand":true,"tool":true},{"actorID":"33","targetID":"2977","newActorID":"33","newTargetID":"3096","hand":true,"tool":true},{"actorID":"33","targetID":"2978","newActorID":"33","newTargetID":"3095","hand":true,"tool":true}],"removedTransitions":[{"actorID":"33","targetID":"2976","newActorID":"33","newTargetID":"2959","hand":true,"tool":true},{"actorID":"33","targetID":"2977","newActorID":"33","newTargetID":"2961","hand":true,"tool":true},{"actorID":"33","targetID":"2978","newActorID":"33","newTargetID":"2960","hand":true,"tool":true}],"objectChanges":[{"id":"2976","attributes":{"name":{"from":"Rickety Fence","to":"Rickety Property Fence"}}}]}]}
