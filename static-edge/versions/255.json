Now it has 4 use states with 1/5 chance of transitioning betwen states after each use.  Same EV, way lower variance.  And no more situations (rare) where it fails on the first pumping.","date":"2019-08-01T00:13:02.000Z","removedObjectIDs":["3082"],"addedTransitions":[{"targetID":"2309","newActorID":"2334","newTargetID":"2308","hand":true},{"targetID":"2309","newActorID":"2334","newTargetID":"3083","hand":true},{"actorID":"248","targetID":"2333","newActorID":"248","newTargetID":"2311","hand":true,"tool":true},{"actorID":"298","targetID":"2332","newActorID":"292","newTargetID":"2333","hand":true},{"actorID":"660","targetID":"2312","newActorID":"1100","newTargetID":"2332","hand":true}],"removedTransitions":[{"targetID":"2309","newActorID":"2334","newTargetID":"3082","hand":true}],"legacyObjects":[{"id":"3082","name":"Perhaps an Exhausted Oil Pumpjack","category":false}]}]}
