Basket and backpack hold a pile of soil, which can be used for a row with a single tilling (in a pinch), or split into 3 soil with a clay bowl.  1 unit of soil can be tilled twice to make a row, or added to a hardened row and tilled once.  Thus, a cart can carry 12 soil.  Goodbye worm tilling.  Shovel of dung no longer containable (that was a bug).  Full water pouch has empty one hidden behind to facilitate sprite subset detection (so creation sound for empty pouch doesn't play when pouch emptied).  This also means that soil deposites and compost piles provide 3x soil (deposite provides 60 soil total over two diggings, and compost pile provides 24 soil).  This might be too much, but we'll see.","date":"2018-06-05T19:27:23.000Z","addedObjectIDs":["1138"],"addedTransitions":[{"actorID":"1137","newActorID":"235","newTargetID":"1138","hand":true},{"actorID":"1137","targetID":"1101","targetUses":"max","newActorID":"235","newTargetID":"1101","targetRemains":true,"hand":true},{"actorID":"1137","targetID":"1105","newTargetUses":"-1","newActorID":"235","newTargetID":"393","hand":true},{"actorID":"1137","targetID":"1138","newTargetUses":"last","newActorID":"235","newTargetID":"1101","hand":true},{"actorID":"1137","targetID":"848","newActorID":"235","newTargetID":"1136","hand":true},{"actorID":"212","targetID":"848","newActorID":"198","newTargetID":"213","hand":true},{"actorID":"235","targetID":"1101","targetUses":"max","newActorID":"1137","newTargetID":"1101","targetRemains":true,"hand":true},{"actorID":"235","targetID":"1101","targetUses":"max","newActorID":"1137","newTargetID":"1138","hand":true},{"actorID":"235","targetID":"1138","newActorID":"1137","hand":true},{"actorID":"336","targetID":"848","newActorID":"292","newTargetID":"213","hand":true},{"actorID":"849","newActorUses":"-1","targetID":"1138","newActorID":"849","newTargetID":"1136","hand":true,"tool":true},{"actorID":"852","targetID":"1138","newActorID":"847","newTargetID":"1136","hand":true}],"removedTransitions":[{"targetID":"901","newTargetID":"902","decay":"1h"},{"targetID":"902","newActorID":"789","newTargetID":"213","hand":true},{"actorID":"212","targetID":"848","newActorID":"198","newTargetID":"1101","hand":true},{"actorID":"336","targetID":"848","newActorID":"292","newTargetID":"1101","hand":true},{"actorID":"789","targetID":"848","newTargetID":"901","hand":true}],"objectChanges":[{"id":"1101","attributes":{"name":{"from":"Fertile Soil","to":"Fertile Soil Pile"}}},{"id":"213","attributes":{"name":{"from":"Tilled Row","to":"Deep Tilled Row"}}}],"legacyObjects":[{"id":"849","name":"@ Row Tiller","category":true},{"id":"1105","name":"@ Non Vigorous Gooseberry","category":true}]},{"sha":"31ac36d770d1380d693bfe48b48304f81052e90b","message":"Languishing bush now has slight color change.","date":"2018-06-05T17:38:29.000Z"},{"sha":"f9b80e52ee8d3b6523999ab7c89c4d6a20a12ae6","message":"Domestic bushes produce 7 berries, for a total of 35 food with bonus (same as carrots).
